## An Equivalence comparison test for root growth rates of cuttings of VD3 and wild-type E. aureum.
To determine whether the genetically transformed clone VD3 grew out roots faster than the wild-type E. aureum, cuttings of young pothos leaves and stems were placed on Murshige and Skoog agar media solidified in petri dishes placed on a slant, exposing one side of the agar bed.** Six cuttings were placed on the exposed edge of the agar, three from wild types and three from transformed clones VD3, on four plates, 12 replicate plantlets for each pothos type. The plates were incubated under light at room temperature for 45 days, after which the length of the roots were measured, as shown in Table  1 and Figure**.

The **null hypothesis being if the two plants (VD3 and wild-type aureum) are different** and the **alternate being that they are equivalent** within an acceptable preset limit theta (or bounds).**
